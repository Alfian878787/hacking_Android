Itâ€™s important to note that a value of 0 for MSE indicates perfect similarity. 
A value greater than one implies less similarity and will continue to grow as the 
average difference between pixel intensities increases as well.

In order to remedy some of the issues associated with MSE for image comparison, we 
have the Structural Similarity Index, developed by Wang et al.:

The SSIM method is clearly more involved than the MSE method, but the gist is that 
SSIM attempts to model the perceived change in the structural information of the 
image, whereas MSE is actually estimating the perceived errors. There is a subtle 
difference between the two, but the results are dramatic.

Furthermore, the equation in Equation 2 is used to compare two windows (i.e. small
sub-samples) rather than the entire image as in MSE. Doing this leads to a more 
robust approach that is able to account for changes in the structure of the image, 
rather than just the perceived change.

The parameters to Equation 2 include the (x, y) location of the N x N window in 
each image, the mean of the pixel intensities in the x and y direction, the 
variance of intensities in the x and y direction, along with the covariance.

Unlike MSE, the SSIM value can vary between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect 
similarity.
